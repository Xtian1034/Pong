My Personal Features Include:
  - The ball will speed up after each hit of the paddle during a given point
  - Slight delay after a point scored to allow the players to prepare themselves for a reset
  - Increased movement speed of the paddles
  - Background music
  - Bouncing ball sound effect following collision with a paddle or wall
  - Victory music following a win
